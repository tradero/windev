windev
======

Because we don't like cygwin and manual installation ;-)

----

Licenses files for all binaries will be kept inside of '_licenses' folder (or not, we will see how it goes with binary files mixing, almost all of these files got information about author attached).

Installation
=====

1. Download: https://github.com/tradero/windev/blob/master/windev.EXE
2. Run
3. Select installation directory (in my case D:\_software)
4. Select user home directory (in my case D:\_projects)
5. ...drink some coffee, watch TV or whatever, depending on your internet connection speed You'll have to wait for downloads (nodejs, python, ruby, php, console2 and sublime)
6. Go thru installation step by step with each installer wizzard
7. that's it...

Console2 will be available from your user home directory, inside of ~/install/Console2/ directory.

Building
=====

Customization of windev should be simple as changing things You're interested of and running build.sh script to generate your new .exe file.

Note: remember that stage1 directory should be as small as it is possible.

TODO
=====

- deinstallator
- update manager (simple git pull should be enough)
- fixing missing git pull ;-D
